## App Title

Welcome to the Dog Adoption App! This web application allows users to browse and adopt dogs in need of a loving home. It provides a platform for dog lovers to connect with dog owners looking to find new homes for their pets.
## User Story:
 As a potential dog owner, I want to be able to browse a list of available dogs for adoption so that I can find a dog that matches my preferences and lifestyle. Acceptance Criteria: When I visit the home page of the app, I should see a list of dog adoption entries, each displaying information about a dog available for adoption. Each dog adoption entry should include details such as the dog's type, age, cost, description, and the contact information of the owner. I should be able to click on a dog adoption entry to view more details about that specific dog. The app should provide a search feature that allows me to filter dogs based on their type, age, and cost. If I'm interested in adopting a dog, I should be able to contact the owner through the provided contact email.
